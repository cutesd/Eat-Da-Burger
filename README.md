# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Burger logger created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handebars, and a homemade ORM (yum!).  Follows MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML.  Deployed using Heroku and JawsDB.
